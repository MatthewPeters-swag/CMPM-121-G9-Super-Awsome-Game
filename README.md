## Tools and materials (WIP)

Engine: Phaser
Language: Type script
Tools:
Visual Studio Code (IDE): This will be our primary source-code editor. As the industry standard, its versatility is unmatched.
GitHub Desktop (Version Control): We will use Git for version control, and GitHub Desktop will be our primary interface.
Deno (Runtime): For any required scripting or backend logic, we will use the Deno runtime for its built-in, first-class support for TypeScript and we’ve all used it on previous assignments.
Vite (Build Tool & Dev Server): For any web-based components or interfaces, Vite will be our build tool, primarily due to its speed.
Why: These tools are widely adopted and represent best practices in the current development industry, making them valuable skills for all team members. Additionally, I have significant personal experience with this entire workflow, which will allow me to help onboard teammates and effectively troubleshoot any issues that arise, ensuring our development process is smooth and productive.
Generative AI: no restrictions

## Important Commands:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Check for linting errors (read-only)
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting errors
- `npm run format` - Format all `.js`, `.json`, and `.md` files
- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are formatted (read-only)

**Note:** Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting and formatting on staged files before each commit. The commit will be blocked if code doesn't pass linting or build tests.

## Outlook

What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?

We want to get more comfortable with the kinds of technology that real software teams use. Working with them in a small project helps us learn how they work, what they do well, and where they can be tricky. We also want to see how these tools affect the way we plan and build things. We also hope to gain practical experience that will help us in future projects.
